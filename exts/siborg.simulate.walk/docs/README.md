# Python Extension [siborg.simulate.walk]

This is a simple extension that lets users select characters and assign them a goal xform to follow (while doing a walk animation). 

It was initially done as a test, and the code may be useful to others. Since this was created a few days after the Beta release of the people plugin, its very likely to break soon.  Please open an issue or make a PR on github if you find problems in the future.
